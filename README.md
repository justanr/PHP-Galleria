PHP-Galleria
============

Just a simple script I whipped up for creating simple PHP powered [galleria.js](http://galleria.io) sites.

As a warning, a lot of the code isn't that great. :(

It's only dependencies are PDO for PHP and Galleria on the client side. That's it (well, and jQuery, because galleria depends on that). No frameworks, not a lot of overhead. Just a handful of PHP functions and a tiny bit of javascript know how.

`index.php` is included as an example implementation of it.
